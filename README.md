Challenging myself to 100 days of python!

Days 1-3 are available on separate branches.

Now, I'll be overwriting master daily.

Day 6
It was quite challenging!

Now that I unlocked functions and while loops, almost anything is possible, can't wait to "learn" about dictionaries! I also learned that tuples are defined using "()" instead of "[]" like arrays. I also learned the 1eN method and the fact that multiline comments are only possible in form of unassigned string literals using """multiline comment here""".

Simulating maze escape was the challenging part, I tested many solutions and did a lot of debugging with the use of print, at first I messed up direction_right - it was inverted for up&down directions, then the movement algorithm was almost there, but stuck in a loop at one point, so I had to add a turn forward, whenever after moving forward the right was free.
