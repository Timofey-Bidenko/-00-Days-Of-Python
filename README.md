Day 3!

I learned about .lower method for strings, some more specific info about BMI and genuinely nothing else you'll see here.
It's just basic logic we've all used. I do know nesting if elif is bad for readabilty and that all of this can be just put into a dictionary (for O(1) compute time), but I didn't quite "learn" that yet, so we'll do bad code practice.
While testing I also found out we could do (number & 1) to check if it's odd, which is faster than what I did here.
I also used import sys to stop the wandering game, but in the end I came to conclusion it stops itself anyways and removed that.
