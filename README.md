Challenging myself to 100 days of python!

Days 1-3 are available on separate branches.

Now, I'll be overwriting master daily.

Day 4, I learned to/about:
- random.choice for arrays
- how to write multiline conditions in python (you have to use "\")

I already knew:
- random module
- arrays, listed arrays
