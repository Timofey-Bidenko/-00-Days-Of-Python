So, what did I learn today?
Uhh
I learned what the BMI means, found a nice replacement to int(N*p)/p; Got to know more about f"", learned that power is "**" and "^" is bitwise XOR (whatever this means, will learn it soon). Also learned floor division exists (the //). 
All types are basically intances of their class, this feels unusual, at least the output saying <class 'str'> instead of just "str" or "string" feels that way.
You can also nest {} inside of f""
