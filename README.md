Challenging myself to 100 days of python!

Days 1-3 are available on separate branches.

Now, I'll be overwriting master daily.

Day 5
- how for loops work for arrays
- how range works and is a separate class, doesn't produce an array like I thought it would

nothing much more there, but the project today was interesting...
I did spend quite some time developing the password generator, as I am limiting myself to use only what I've learned to this point of the challenge. Looks like it's still quite optimized, only need to use dictionary for checking if a character is already in use instead of doing O(n) searches each iteration. I didn't "learn" what dictionaries are from this challenge yet, so I'll keep it as is.
